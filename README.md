Bioinformatics - Semantic interoperability: OntoPortal snapshot 

OntoPortal technology is a generic resource to build ontology repositories or, more broadly, semantic artefact catalogues that can simultaneously co-host and fully support resources that span from SKOS thesauri to OBO, RDF-S, and OWL ontologies. [[1]](#1).

OntoPortal provides endpoints for accessing its content: a REST web service API that returns JSON-LD;

In this work, a batch process has been developed to download a snapshot of the ontologies contained in each OntoPortal repository.
